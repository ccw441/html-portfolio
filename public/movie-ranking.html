<h1> The Best Movies According to Chelsea</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h2>The Lion King</h2>
<p>This is my favorite Disney film. 
It's a sweet and heartwarming film that can 
be watched over and over again, and still love every 
moment of the movie.</p>

<h2>The Lady and the Tramp</h2>
<p>This is my second favorite Disney film. It's a great story 
of opposites, uniting. It's another sweet, heartwarming 
film that has dogs as the main characters.

<h2>The Prince of Egypt</h2>
<p>This is my third favorite animated film. 
I believe it's a Dreamworks production, 
and it's a great story of redemption, inspiration and revolution.
It's a wonderful film that mirrors the epics 
and majestic adventures expressed in human culture.
